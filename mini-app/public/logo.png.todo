A stylized question mark design with a bold, modern look. The background should be a vibrant gradient that transitions from deep blue at the top to bright teal at the bottom, giving the image a dynamic, energetic feel. The question mark itself should be large, centered, and rendered in white with a subtle drop shadow to make it stand out against the gradient. No additional text or icons should be present; the focus is solely on the question mark as a symbol of curiosity and learning.
